<h2>FAQ regarding weddings:</h2>

<h2>If I use your service, does that mean I can only work with certain vendors?</h2>

<p>Absolutely not!  One of the benefits of working with our company is that we create a plan that works for you.  If you know where you want the reception, the florist, and the DJ yet you need help with the rental equipment, the photographer, and the cake baker, we will be happy to both work with the vendors already selected as well as make recommendations for companies that can assist with the remainder of the needs.  The good news:  we will do the research for you before recommending anyone:  are they available on your day, are they within your price range, and is what you need available.</p>

<h2>Can you help by directing the ceremony?</h2>

<p>Absolutely.  When we meet together, simply let us know that the ceremony direction is something you will need and we'll make sure that is in the proposal prepared for you.   This will include direction at the rehearsal as well as the ceremony itself.</p>

<h2>My budget is already tight - can I afford a wedding planner?</h2>

<p>While this is an additional expense in your overall budget, it is well worth it.  Price is determined by what you need so first, it may be more affordable than you think.  Second, working with a planner can in some cases save you money as tried and true savings ideas will be presented.  Having a planning partner who works with brides and grooms on a regular basis can come in handy in making your budget work for you.</p>

<h2>Are consultations free?</h2>

<p>Yes!  All in the Details will meet with you at your convenience for a free consultation with no obligation to you.  Just call or e-mail to make an appointment.</p>
