<h2>Corporate Events Planning by All in the Details</h2>

<p>Coming from a sales and marketing background and often being involved in <b>various events to market new products, promote additional services,</b> etc., I thought many times that if my boss knew <b>how much time planning and participating in these events was taking me</b> and therefore taking me away from my sales job, he would be quite unhappy and would minimize my involvement in similar future projects.</p>

<p>As a company, <b>outsourcing the planning of your events</b>:  product launches, employee appreciation events, customer appreciation, holiday parties, training seminars, etc., may seem like an unnecessary expense.  However, back to my statement above, outsourcing this planning to a professional <b>allows your employees to focus on what they do best</b>:  their sales, their marketing, the administrative support.  <b>You will lose more money and productivity by taking them away</b> from their daily responsibilities than by outsourcing the research, planning, coordination, and execution of your events.  And, its all about doing what you do best everyday.</p>

<h2>FAQ about Corporate Events:</h2>

<h2>My company has a social committee that plans all of our events.  Why should I hire you when they are already in place?</h2>

<img src="images/march6.JPG" height="102" width="152" class="pull-right" alt="Image shows corporate event planned by All in the Details. Greenville NC" />

<p>As events come and go within companies, the social committee is typically pulled together event by event.  With the other responsibilities that they are also accountable for, they are forced to wear many "different hats."  They are stretched and less likely to feel comfortable with the many aspects of planning and executing a successful event.  Hiring someone who excels and focuses completely on event planning will make your events more successful and allow your employees to concentrate on their daily tasks.  Plus, they can enjoy the event as well!</p>

<h2>If we need help with meeting planning, can you provide administrative support?  </h2>

<p>If your event requires copies of manuals/handouts, event registration services, and assistance with items such as evaluations, we are here to help.  Simply let us know those services are requested during our consultation and we'll go from there.</p>


<h2>How much will an event planner cost?</h2>

<p>As each event is priced based on what you need, the fees depend on the services requested.  But, no matter what the cost, hiring a planner to coordinate and implement your event is less expensive than hiring new full or part time staff to handle this responsibility.</p>
